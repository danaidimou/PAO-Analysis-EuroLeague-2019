# PAO-Analysis-EuroLeague-2019
This is a project containing basic analysis on Panathinaikos's performance in 2019's EuroLeague. 

I got this dataset from Kaggle. It had data from 2003-2019 and I deciced to analyse last year's performance.
The Analysis I did consists of Panathinaikos's Home vs Away performance, Quarter by quarter performance, PAO's lost lead games, their performance over time, game distribution throughout the year and conclusions. 

In the bar chart on the average performance for Panathinaikos's Home vs Away games we can tell that PAO performed well at home, both offensively and defensively. The extra offensive output at home gave them an edge in securing wins. While their defense reamined strong away from home, the small drop in offensive production likely affected their ability to win close games on the road. 

On the visualisation on PAOs average quarter-by-quarter performance at home vs away you can see that they consistenly started stronger at home compared to away games. The fourth quarter for away games was their highest-scoring quarter, while their third quarter was their weakest at home. The significant dip in scoring during the third quarter at home is a concern, and suggests that they struggled coming out of a halftime in those games. 

I was interested in looking into PAO's lost lead games and here's what I found out. The fourth quarter had the highest average points scored at 21.7 points, indicating a stronger performance toward the end of the games. The second quarter had the lowest average points scored at 19 points, indicating relatively weaker performance in the second quarter. PAO performed better in the first and third quarters compared to the second, but the final push in the fourth quarter appears to be their strongest. 

Based on the data showing points scored and points conceded by Panathinaikos, here are some key insights:
PAO scored between 70 and 90 points in most games. This shows their offense was relatively consistent. Conceded points vary significantly. PAO had solid defensive games where they held their opponents to under 70 points. PAO had a strong offensice performance, consistently scoring over 75 points. The defensive variability is a clear challenge. Games where PAO conceded over 90 points were often losses.In the Pie Chart we can see that PAO played 14.8% of their games where the score difference was 5 points or less, suggesting that a smaller portion of their games were tight and competitive. 33.3% of PAO's games ended in defeat, meaning they lost one third of their total games. Over half of PAO's games were decided by more than 5 point indicating that the majority of their matches had a clear winner. This suggests that PAO was either in control or outmatched in most of their games. 

In 2019, Panathinaikos showed strong home performance, scoring more and defending well, but struggled with offensive consistency on the road. Their third-quarter weakness at home and fewer close game wins impacted their season's success. Panathinaikos did not reach the EuroLeague FInal Four, as they were eliminated in the playoffs by Real Madrid in a 3-0 series sweep. Thank you for reading.
